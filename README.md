🌍 HTML Project – My Beginner Webpage

This project is a simple webpage that I created while learning HTML. I wanted to understand how real websites are built from scratch, so I made this page using only basic HTML tags — no CSS, no JavaScript, just pure structure.

While working on this project, I focused on writing clean and meaningful code. I used different HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, and semantic tags to make the page easy to read and well organized.
My main goal was to get comfortable with the basics and learn how to properly arrange content inside a webpage.

🔹 What this project includes

A neat and structured HTML layout

A simple navigation flow

Well-organized content sections

Use of semantic tags for better readability

Basic images and text formatting

A beginner-friendly code style

🔹 Why I built this

I created this project to practice everything I learned in HTML so far. Instead of only doing small exercises, I wanted to build something complete that feels like an actual webpage.
Working on this helped me understand:

how a webpage is structured

how content should be arranged

why clean HTML matters before styling with CSS

🔹 What I learned

Writing cleaner, more meaningful HTML

Using proper tags instead of random ones

Structuring a webpage like real developers do

Planning layout before writing code

🔹 My future plan

After learning CSS, I will revisit this project to style it properly and make it visually appealing.
For now, this page represents my first step into web development.
